# LHC_Database
This is a public repository with the database for the Hydrogen linear chains with homogenous stretching for the paper "Gaussian Processes for Finite Size Extrapolation of Many-Body Simualtions".
The data base contains the bond lengths in Bohr and energy per atom in Ha for each chain,
in the basis-set STO-6G using UHF and open boundary conditions. The CCSD(T) calculations were performed with Pyscf, the columns of each file contanins the bond length, UHF, CCSD and CCSD(T) calculations respectively.
The AFQMC performed with QMCPACK have the same reference, the columns of each file contanints the bond length, UHF, AFQMC and AFQMC/error.
